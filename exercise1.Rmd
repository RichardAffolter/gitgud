```
### Sample 100 values from a log-normal distribution
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
m <- 1
s <- 0.25
location <- log(m^2 / sqrt(s^2 + m^2))
shape <- sqrt(log(1 + (s^2 / m^2)))
x <- rlnorm(n=100, location, shape)
```


### create a histogram of the distribution and the distribution on the log scale
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(x), binwidth = 1/16)+ labs(title = expression("Histogram of log-normal distribution, " ~ mu ~ " = 1, "~ sigma ~ " = 0.25"))

ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(x), binwidth = 1/16) + scale_x_log10() +
labs(title = expression("Histogram of log-normal distribution, " ~ mu ~ " = 1, "~ sigma ~ " = 0.25, log-scale"))
```


### Report the mean and variance of the sample
The mean of the sample is `r toString(round(mean(x),3))` and the variance is `r toString(round(sd(x),3))`.
